connectivity_overlay
====================

(test) project to compute geographic transportation connectivity metrics, overlaid on a Leaflet/Django/Mapnik/OpenStreetMap map.


This project is extremely raw. At the moment, I'm just trying to render a map in a browser. 

Subsequently, I'll probably play around with Mapnik via its Python bindings, and I see if I can figure out how to compute something related to what I'm interested in.
